# Traffic-Monitoring-in-Bangladesh

In this project, we'll be working with traffic video feed data from Dhaka, Bangladesh. The goal is to take each frame of video and detect and label objects such as cars and people in real-time. We'll use both a pre-trained model but extend an existing model to detect custom objects for the task of analyzing traffic feed data.
Things we'll learn are:
•	Worked with XML data that have bounding box data
•	Extracted frames from video files
•	Applied the pretrained YOLO object detection model
•	Trained YOLO to extend it to detect custom objects
